<h1 class="text-center">KALDEI'S SECURITY NOTES</h1>


## What can you find here? ðŸ”®
My notes about cybersecurity and stuff. Could be useful to someone, so I share them. 

These notes are "Cheat Sheets", they allow me to quickly recall and reuse tools and technics I've encountered. 
Disclaimer: My notes are more or less updated and most likely contain mistakes or things that will not work. If you find something broken feel free to reach me.

      This category gathers notes I use in the different stages of an attack.
      They are arranged, kinda like the "Cyber Kill Chain" model, in 5 steps (Enumeration, Vulnerability Assessment, Gaining Access, Foothold, and Privilege Escalation).

      This category gathers notes that detail the use of all the cybersecurity tools I encountered (most of them are offensive tools).
      There is no particular organization here: theses notes are sorted in alphabetical order.
