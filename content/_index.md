<h1 class="text-center">KALDEI'S SEC NOTES</h1>


## What can you find here? ðŸ”®
My personal notes about cybersecurity and stuff. Could be useful to someone, so I share them. 

These notes take the form of "Cheat Sheets". This allow me to quickly recall and reuse tools that I've encountered. 
This website is a never-ending work in progress: I am currently in the process of converting my notes to the right format, and I will continue to feed them as I learn new things.

Disclaimer: My notes are more or less updated and most likely contain mistakes or things that will not work. If you find something broken feel free to reach me.

    <p>This category gathers notes I use in the different stages of an attack. They are arranged, kinda like the "Cyber Kill Chain" model, in 6 steps (Enumeration, Vulnerability Assessment, Gaining Access, Foothold, Privilege Escalation, and Post Exploitation).</p>
