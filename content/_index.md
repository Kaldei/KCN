<h1 class="text-center">KALDEI'S SEC NOTES</h1>

## What is this site? ðŸ”®
Since I began my studies, I got into the habit of taking notes. These notes take the form of "Cheat Sheets" and allow me to quickly recall and reuse tools that I've seen and studied. 

I decided to publish here my cybersecurity-related notes to share my work (maybe my notes could be useful to others!).

This site is a work in progress: I am in the process of converting my notes to the right format and will continue to feed them as I learn.

## What can you find here? ðŸ§­
My notes are sorted (for now) into two categories:

<article class="card shadow-1 rounded-3 white post-entry">
  <header class="entry-header">
    <div class="h2">Kill Chain</div>    
  </header>
  <p>This category gathers notes I use in the different attack stages. They are are arranged, kinda like the "Cyber Kill Chain" model, in 6 steps: Enumeration, Vulnerability Assessment, Gaining Access, Foothold, Privilege Escalation, and Post Exploitation.</p>

</article>
<article class="card shadow-1 rounded-3 white post-entry">
  <header class="entry-header">
    <div class="h2">Tools</div>
  </header>
  <p>This category gathers notes that detail the use of the different cybersecurity tools I know (most of them are red team tools but some of them are blue team). There is no particular organization here: they're sorted in alphabetical order.</p>

## Whoami? ðŸ¥·
I'm Kaldei, a computer engineering student aiming for a cybersecurity specialization and an insane desire to work as Pentester!
